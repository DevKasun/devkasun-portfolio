                    Hey! I'm a developer with <span class="font-bold">7+ years of experience</span> building beautiful, responsive web applications using React, Next.js, and modern web technologies. I love transforming design ideas into pixel-perfect, interactive experiences that users actually enjoy.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    My passion is creating high-quality code and sharing what I've learned along the way. You'll find my work across projects that showcase everything from complex financial dashboards to sleek user interfaces. I'm also into making video content and reading books about tech, design, and building better products.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio, check out my latest projects, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about frontend development. I'm always excited to work on interesting challenges and help others grow in their coding journey.
